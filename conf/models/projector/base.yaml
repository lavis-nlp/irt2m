#   prefix: short prefix based on the configuration (see train._build_prefix)
#   dataset: the (normalised) upstream IRT2.name property (e.g. irt2-cde-l)

# which kgc evaluations to run while training
evaluations:
  - kgc/train         # closed world kgc with original embeddings (run once before training)
  - kgc/transductive  # closed world kgc with projections (irt2.closed_triples)
  - kgc/inductive     # open world kgc with projections (irt2.open_kgc_val*)
